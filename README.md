Flappy Bird Project

I'd like to take a crack at recreating flappy bird. It's a game with a simple goal, get your object between the pipes that will be moving towards you without touching the ground or hitting the pipes. If you get through the pipes you earn a point and if the object collides with anything the game is over. 

There can be a condition where if the player earns a certain amount of points they win the game. Once the game is completed there can be additional patches made to adjust the difficulty of the game as the player progresses.

The player will press a button to keep their object in the air. The button will smoothly increment the object's Y position to a max value and then once that value is reached the object's Y position will begin to decrement smoothly. 

The pipes will move towards the player on the X-axis and will each have varying heights. The middle of each pipe should be missing so the object can pass through. The pipes will screen wrap once they leave the screen, like how when Pacman goes all the way right or left.

That's all there is.
